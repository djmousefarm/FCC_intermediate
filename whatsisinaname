// ugh, i hate this but i really struggled with this and found a lot of the answer here : 
// http://forum.freecodecamp.com/t/wherefore-art-thou-help-needed/44471/2
// I did use foreach instead of a for loop, made sense as i was going through an array and it reduces the number of parameters cluttering
// things up a bit but other than commenting the code, which is not great in itself, i cannot honestly say that i did this all myself.

// Hopefuly i'll learn a bit and can come back and refactor this.
